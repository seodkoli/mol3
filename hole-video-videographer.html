Video editing is the process of selecting, trimming, arranging, and enhancing video footage to create a cohesive and engaging final product. Video production, however, involves the entire process of creating a video from start to finish, including planning, filming, and post-production editing."

"acceptedAnswer": {
"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Experienced and highly skilled video editors can earn a substantial income, especially if they work on high-budget projects or for reputable clients. However, income levels for video editors can vary widely depending on factors such as their level of expertise, the industry they work in, geographic location, and the demand for their services."
